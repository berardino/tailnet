# tailnet

A Rust implementation of `tcpdump`.  Why ? Because it has been a while
since I did some raw socket programming, and I thought this could have been an
interesting and fun project to work on, with plenty of opportunities to explore
and learn Rust.

This project is my next step in learning rust and experimenting with network programming.
The first one was [SkyNet](https://github.com/berardino/skynet), a toy project that I built
in a couple of hours! I â™¥ Rust.

Stay tuned!
